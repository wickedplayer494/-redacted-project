This is the [redacted] project - it lives on, but with a different porpoise this time. If you are viewing this in the future, this will probably contain experimental stuff, since I have no intentions of using Java, as it is insecure as all hell.

Planned features of this [redacted] project, which will have a codename, then maybe a real name when TFi kicks off (and hopefully doesn't pull a Canwest immediately) include, but are not limited to:

- Item acquisition capturing & sending to server
- POV reconstruction
- (D)DoS attacking IP capturing
 - Automatic WHOIS abuse email sending (through the site)
- Killcam sending
- Other things - they'll be added as I go along with this and as development progresses
